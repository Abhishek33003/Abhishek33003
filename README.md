### 👋 Hey there! "I'm passionate about becoming a DevOps Engineer" 🚀

I'm transitioning into the world of **DevOps Engineering** from an academic background in **BSc and LLB**, combined with professional experience in the **medical billing industry**.

Curious by nature and driven by hands-on learning, I'm currently focused on mastering the tools and practices that shape modern infrastructure and automation.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack I'm Exploring:

- 🐧 **Linux** – Exploring bash scripting, user and permission management (useradd, chmod, chown), and daily tools like vim for editing and automation basics
- 🐳 **Docker** – Containerization, Dockerfiles, Compose
- ⚙️ **Ansible** – Provisioning, configuration management
- ☁️ **AWS** – EC2, S3, IAM, CLI, VPC, CloudWatch
- 🔁 **Jenkins** – Building robust CI/CD pipelines
- 🧱 **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** – Container orchestration & deployment
- 🗃️ **Git & GitHub** – Version control, collaboration

---

### 📌 What I'm Building:

- 🔧 End-to-end CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins & GitHub Actions  
- ☁️ Infrastructure automation with Terraform + AWS  
- 🐳 Containerized microservices using Docker & Kubernetes  
- 📜 Ansible playbooks for system provisioning & config  
- 🧑‍💻 Linux labs for real-world troubleshooting practice
